## **Project Aims and Background**
A laundry-pickup sevices startup is in a Blue Ocean that are building its network in smaller citites that are not targeted by the big players in the laundry service industry. This startup already had a strong presence in 140 locations in the USA. It has recently opened stores in 10 new cities. The company would like to find out which of the 10 new locations have the best potential for the company to invest more funds into marketing and can potentially have the best ROMI (Return on marketing investment).

## **Exploratory Data Analysis via Data Visualization**
First we want to get a good idea of where the services are located in the United States. And we can also visualize how much revenue the cities are roughly earning, the bigger the circles, the more the revenue.

We can see from the image that the services location of the startup are spreaded throughout the country. But it is not visible to us whether there is a trend in the revenue or not just by looking at this map.

Since this project is focusing on the services in the new cities, we want to highlight those new cities to see where they are located in the map.
