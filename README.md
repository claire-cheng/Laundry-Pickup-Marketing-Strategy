## **Project Aims and Background**
A laundry-pickup sevices startup is in a Blue Ocean that are building its network in smaller citites that are not targeted by the big players in the laundry service industry. This startup already had a strong presence in 140 locations in the USA. It has recently opened stores in 10 new cities. The company would like to find out which of the 10 new locations have the best potential for the company to invest more funds into marketing and can potentially have the best ROMI (Return on marketing investment).
